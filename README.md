# Kanimaji #

uchisen.com uses python scripts remixed from [maurimo](https://github.com/maurimo) to generate the animated .svg files. 
Original kanji .svg files provided by the [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/) project.


## Usage ##

If you really want to generate your own animated .svgs, I'd highly recommend you go to the [original project](https://github.com/maurimo/kanimaji) and download it there, as that's set up for general use and provides great documentation on how to use it.


But, if you still want to use this for some reason you should create a folder "kanji" at the root of this project and add any .svgs you want to convert there.

Run run_script.py  to change all kanji in the kanji/ folder into animated svgs.

Running delete_extra_files.py script will remove all kanji not found on uchisen from the kanji/ folder.
